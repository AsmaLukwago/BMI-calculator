> **BMI Calculator** is a **Body Mass Index(BMI)** calculator app developed with **<a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter" target="_blank">Flutter</a>**.<br />
Currently, the BMI is calculated using **Metric** units. Support for **Imperial** units may be added in the future.<br />
The app also supports **English** and **Turkish** languages. I have plans for supporting more languages.
